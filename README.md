# Road Map (GoTH Stack?)
## Purpose
- To Learn HTTP in Go along with database interaction and HTMX for fun.

## GoTH Stack
- Go, Turso, HTMX
- Only the most based cutting edge stack.

## Checklist
- [ ] Learn how to spawn an http server in Go to make requests.
- [ ] Create a simple frontend that makes requests to the server (HTMX?).
- [ ] Need a server to store the url data. (TURSO?)
- [ ] Maybe host a live example on Azure or something like that.

## HTTP Server
- Use the Go http builtin.
- Configure request endpoints.

## Turso
- Sqlite style database, not really a reason to use it other than to learn
something modern.

## HTMX
- Again not strictly necessary but if I can avoid doing JS, I will.
- Also cool way to do HTML.
